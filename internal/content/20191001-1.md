Title: Webcamoid 8.7.0 released!  
Date: 2019-10-01  
Summary: On Android port status, fixed camera blinking, many bug fixes and improvements.  

## Android port keep moving forward

Webcamoid for Android is nearest that never. Even though Webcamoid is not ready to be used in Android yet, there has been a lot of advances to make it work in the mobile platform. All its basic features are working: camera capture, screen capture, video playback and recording.  
The UI still does not play well with small screen devices, this is a pending task that will be solved before the official release.  
You can read more at the [Android port](https://github.com/webcamoid/webcamoid/issues/169) issue. Also, if you feel a bit adventurous you can download and test the APK at the [daily build](https://bintray.com/webcamoid/webcamoid/webcamoid/daily#files/android) page.

## Fixed camera blinking

When you changed the format, resolution or FPS, Webcamoid was turning on and off the webcam quickly many times, if you had a webcam with a led indicator, you can notice the led was blinking many times when you changed the format.  
I think this is related to issue [#148](https://github.com/webcamoid/webcamoid/issues/148), this bug was probably triggering a hardware bug that did not allowed the camera to recover its normal parameters.

## Bug fixes and improvements

Many unnecessary plugins were removed like Bin and Probe plugins. Also, unnecessary sub-modules like OSS and QtAudio were removed.  
Also, error messages for the virtual camera were improved, making a bit easier to debug problems when installing the virtual camera.  
And finally there were fixed some elusive segfaults when switching between effects.
